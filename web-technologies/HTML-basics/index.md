# Theory: HTML Basics

### What is HTML?

HTML is a language used to create web pages: it manages their structure and content. HTML is an abbreviation, it stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. Hypertext refers to text information that is connected to other texts through links, weaving together this interconnected spiderweb of pages.

Here is a simple visualization of what hypertext is. It should look more than familiar to you, an experienced Internet user:

</center>

Markup language helps the browser recognize text information and serve it to the reader in a convenient form. There are other hypertext markup languages, but the vast majority of pages on the Internet are written in HTML.

### Short history

HTML was developed by Tim Berners-Lee, a member of the Swiss scientific laboratory CERN. The release of the first HTML version is attributed to 1989. In 1991 the language was supplemented and began to be used to transfer hypertext on the Internet. Initially, HTML was created for data exchange between scientists within the same institution.

If you are curious, you can still visit [the first HTML site](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/www/theproject.html "first html site") created on August 6, 1991. For many years it had not been available, but in 2016 the site was restored.

### HTML today

Today sites written in HTML look a lot different from the first one. You probably stumble upon them every day â€” look at this one, for example:

<img src="images/html-basics/example_site.PNG" alt="url" width="500" height="300"/>

_An example is a screenshot of the Greenpeace website (https://www.greenpeace.org)._

You can make sure that HTML is indeed responsible for the structure of the page by opening its source code. It's very easy to do: right-click and find the **View Page Source** line or simply use the **CTRL+U** key combination, and you'll see something like this:

<img src="images/html-basics/example_view_page_source.png" alt="url" width="500" height="300" />

Billions of people see the results of their browser's interpretation of HTML documents every day on their computers and mobile devices. Even though the main readers of HTML are browsers, any person can easily understand its structure since this language is simple and logical, yet knowing it well often helps a great deal in today's world

### Advantages of HTML

HTML has gained great popularity due to its undeniable advantages:

- The language is easy to learn and use;

- It is supported by all common browsers;

- It can be integrated with programming languages.

Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of HTML, once said: "The Web turned data into the gold of the 21st century". Expanding this metaphor, we can say that HTML is a primary tool for mining and storing the precious metal.
